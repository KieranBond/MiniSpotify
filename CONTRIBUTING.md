### Standards

* Ensure that code contributed adheres to coding standards already visible in the codebase. 
 * An admin will ensure that code contributed follows these standards, and will comment on them in Pull requests if not followed - delaying code adjustments/contributions.

* Ensure that Pull Requests are targeted to merge back into the `development` branch. Ideally, any changes you are making should be made on feature branches too unless discussed previously or are of small nature.

### Branch Standards

Development should occur in feature or bug branches, branched from the latest commit on the `development` branch and kept up to date with the `development` branch as often as possible. 

Branch names should be structured as so: `type/#issuenumber-name-of-branch`.

Examples:
 * feature/#100-volume-slider
 * bug/#90-shuffle-button-crash
